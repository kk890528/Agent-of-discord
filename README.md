# Project Abstract

Focusing on the polarization driven by online political bots, this study examines the conditions under which bots with diverse ideological positions amplify societal divisions. Specifically, we analyze critical factors such as the ratio of bots in the network, levels of homophily, tolerance thresholds, and the centrality of bots. These factors collectively shape scenarios where bots either intensify or mitigate polarization. For more details, the full paper is available at https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439324127.

# Repository and Components Overview

Most of this project is written in Python. Python scripts are used to construct the model, simulate the model, and analyze model outputs.
 
This project had three main components that can be found in different subdirectories within this repository:

- model: the python code and pseudocode of theoretical & computational model that is at the core of this project.
- graphs: the graphs in the paper.
